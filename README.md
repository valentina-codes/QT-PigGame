# QT-PigGame
Dice game written in QT. This is my first QT Desktop App, to grasp the basic concepts and get comfortable with the software.

## The game 

from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)):

> Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
> * If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
> * If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
> * If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
> The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
